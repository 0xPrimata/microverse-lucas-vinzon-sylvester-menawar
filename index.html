          1992 – 1996 - Okocha joined Eintracht Frankfurt in December 1991,
          where he linked up with many well-known players including Ghanaian
          international striker Tony Yeboah and later Thomas Doll.
        </li>
        <li>
          1996 – 1998 - Okocha joined Turkish club Fenerbahçe for approximately £1
          million following Eintracht Frankfurt's relegation to the 2.
          Bundesliga. In his two seasons with the team, he amassed 30 goals in
          62 appearances, many of them coming from direct free kicks, which
          became something of a trademark for him at the club. Okocha
          acquired Turkish citizenship as Muhammet Yavuz while playing for
          Fenerbahçe.
        </li>
        <li>
          1998 – 2002 - In 1998, French side Paris Saint-Germain spent around
          £14 million to sign Okocha, making him the most expensive African
          player at the time. During his four-year stint with PSG, he played 84
          matches and scored 12 goals. He has also served as a mentor, at the
          time, for young Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho during his time in
          Paris.
        </li>
        <li>
          2002 – 2006 - Okocha joined Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer after
          leaving PSG in the summer of 2002 after the FIFA World Cup. His debut
          season, despite being hampered by injuries, made him a favourite with
          the Bolton fans, with the team printing shirts with the inscription
          "Jay-Jay – so good they named him twice". He steered the team away
          from relegation with seven goals, including the team Goal of the
          Season in the vital league win against West Ham United. This was voted
          Bolton's best Premier League goal in a fans vote in 2008.
        </li>
        <li>
          2007 – 2008 - After just one season in Qatar, Football League
          Championship side Hull City signed Okocha on a free transfer in 2007,
          after the player had been linked to Real Salt Lake and Sydney FC.
